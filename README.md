# 🎬 Movie Industry Analysis (Python Project)

This project analyzes the movie industry using a Kaggle dataset of over 7,000 films. The goal was to practice Python data analysis and uncover insights about what drives box office success.  

---

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies)  
- **Rows:** ~7,600  
- **Columns:** Movie title, director, writer, star, release year, budget, gross revenue, genre, rating, score, number of voters, country, company, runtime.  

---

## 🛠️ Steps
1. Imported and cleaned the dataset (handled missing/inconsistent values).  
2. Performed exploratory data analysis and correlation checks.  
3. Visualized relationships between budget, revenue, ratings, and genres.  
4. Identified top companies, directors, writers, and actors by revenue and score.  

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Strong positive correlation between **budget and gross revenue**.  
- Revenue also correlates with **number of voters** and **movie score**.  
- **PG-13** films generally achieve the highest gross revenue.  
- **Action and Animation** are the top genres by revenue.  
- Identified leading **companies, directors, and stars** by total box office.
