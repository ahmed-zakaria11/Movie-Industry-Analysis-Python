## 🔧 Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies)  
- **Rows:** ~7,600  
- **Columns:** Movie title, director, writer, star, release year, budget, gross revenue, genre, rating, score, number of voters, country, company, runtime.  

---

## 🛠️ Steps
1. Imported and cleaned the dataset (handled missing/inconsistent values).  
2. Performed exploratory data analysis and correlation checks.  
3. Visualized relationships between budget, revenue, ratings, and genres.  
4. Identified top companies, directors, writers, and actors by revenue and score.
